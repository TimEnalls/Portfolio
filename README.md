# My Portfolio

This repository contains Data Science projects I worked on in the past. The projects are all in one repository to enable ease of navigation for some users.

Here are the projects so far:

**1. Supervised Learning** - Used Scikit-Learn to predict whether an individual earned an adequate income amount to be a potential charity donor; implemented and evaluated algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and AdaBoost; determined the field attributes with the highest feature importances to reduce training and prediction time.

**2. Deep Learning (Image Classification)** - Implemented a deep learning network using PyTorch to classify images.

**3. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)** - Utilized clustering algorithms such as K-means and Principle Component Analysis to compare a business's customer data to external demographic data to identify over and under-represented populations in the customer data.
