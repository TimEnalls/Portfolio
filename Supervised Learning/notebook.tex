    In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you,
and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality
necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin
with \textbf{`Implementation'} in the header indicate that the following
block of code will require additional functionality which you must
provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the
specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}TODO\textquotesingle{}} statement. Please be
sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must
answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section
where you will answer a question is preceded by a \textbf{`Question X'}
header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the
following text boxes that begin with \textbf{`Answer:'}. Your project
submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the
questions and the implementation you provide.

\subsection{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your
choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from
the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm
from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best
model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a
model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than
\$50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where
organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income
can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to
request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it
can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket
directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value
from other publically available features.

The dataset for this project originates from the
\href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income}{UCI Machine
Learning Repository}. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry
Becker, after being published in the article \emph{``Scaling Up the
Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid''}. You can
find the article by Ron Kohavi
\href{https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf}{online}. The
data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original
dataset, such as removing the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}fnlwgt\textquotesingle{}} feature and records
with missing or ill-formatted entries.

Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the
census data. Note that the last column from this dataset,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}income\textquotesingle{}}, will be our target
label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, \$50,000
annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the
census database.

\subsection{Preparing the Data}\label{preparing-the-data}}

Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it
often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured --- this is typically
known as \textbf{preprocessing}. Fortunately, for this dataset, there
are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are
some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This
preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive
power of nearly all learning algorithms.

    \hypertarget{transforming-skewed-continuous-features}{%
\subsubsection{Transforming Skewed Continuous
Features}\label{transforming-skewed-continuous-features}}

A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend
to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of
vastly larger or smaller values than that single number. Algorithms can
be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the
range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features
fit this description: '\texttt{capital-gain\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-loss\textquotesingle{}}.

Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note
the range of the values present and how they are distributed.

    For highly-skewed feature distributions such as
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-gain\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-loss\textquotesingle{}}, it is common
practice to apply a logarithmic transformation on the data so that the
very large and very small values do not negatively affect the
performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation
significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must
be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of
\texttt{0} is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small
amount above \texttt{0} to apply the the logarithm successfully.

Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and
visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are
distributed.

\subsubsection{Normalizing Numerical
Features}\label{normalizing-numerical-features}}

In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly
skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on
numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the
shape of each feature's distribution (such as
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-gain\textquotesingle{}} or
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}capital-loss\textquotesingle{}} above);
however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when
applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied,
observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original
meaning, as exampled below.

Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html}{\texttt{sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler}}
for this.

\subsubsection{Implementation: Data
Preprocessing}\label{implementation-data-preprocessing}}

From the table in \textbf{Exploring the Data} above, we can see there
are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically,
learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that
non-numeric features (called \emph{categorical variables}) be converted.
One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the
\textbf{one-hot encoding} scheme. One-hot encoding creates a
\emph{``dummy''} variable for each possible category of each non-numeric
feature. For example, assume \texttt{someFeature} has three possible
entries: \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, or \texttt{C}. We then encode this
feature into \texttt{someFeature\_A}, \texttt{someFeature\_B} and
\texttt{someFeature\_C}.

~~\textbar{} someFeature \textbar{} \textbar{} someFeature\_A \textbar{}
someFeature\_B \textbar{} someFeature\_C \textbar{}\\
:-: \textbar{} :-: \textbar{} \textbar{} :-: \textbar{} :-: \textbar{}
:-: \textbar{}\\
0 \textbar{} B \textbar{} \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 1 \textbar{} 0
\textbar{}\\
1 \textbar{} C \textbar{} ----\textgreater{} one-hot encode
----\textgreater{} \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 1 \textbar{}\\
2 \textbar{} A \textbar{} \textbar{} 1 \textbar{} 0 \textbar{} 0
\textbar{}

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the
non-numeric target label,
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}income\textquotesingle{}} to numerical values
for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible
categories for this label (``\textless{}=50K'' and
``\textgreater{}50K''), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply
encode these two categories as \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}, respectively.
In code cell below, you will need to implement the following: - Use
\href{http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies\#pandas.get_dummies}{\texttt{pandas.get\_dummies()}}
to perform one-hot encoding on the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}features\_log\_minmax\_transform\textquotesingle{}}
data. - Convert the target label
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}income\_raw\textquotesingle{}} to numerical
entries. - Set records with ``\textless{}=50K'' to \texttt{0} and
records with ``\textgreater{}50K'' to \texttt{1}.

\subsection{Evaluating Model
Performance}\label{evaluating-model-performance}}

In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and
determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms
will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is
known as a \emph{naive predictor}.

    \hypertarget{metrics-and-the-naive-predictor}{%
\subsubsection{Metrics and the Naive
Predictor}\label{metrics-and-the-naive-predictor}}

\emph{CharityML}, equipped with their research, knows individuals that
make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity.
Because of this, \emph{CharityML} is particularly interested in
predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that
using \textbf{accuracy} as a metric for evaluating a particular model's
performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that
\emph{does not} make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be
detrimental to \emph{CharityML}, since they are looking to find
individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely
predict those that make more than \$50,000 is \emph{more important} than
the model's ability to \textbf{recall} those individuals. We can use
\textbf{F-beta score} as a metric that considers both precision and
recall:

\[ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} \]

In particular, when \(\beta = 0.5\), more emphasis is placed on
precision. This is called the \textbf{F\(_{0.5}\) score} (or F-score for
simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000,
and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more
than \$50,000. This can greatly affect \textbf{accuracy}, since we could
simply say \emph{``this person does not make more than \$50,000''} and
generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a
statement would be called \textbf{naive}, since we have not considered
any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to
consider the \emph{naive prediction} for your data, to help establish a
benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using
that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less
than \$50,000, \emph{CharityML} would identify no one as donors.

\hypertarget{note-recap-of-accuracy-precision-recall}{%
\paragraph{Note: Recap of accuracy, precision,
recall}\label{note-recap-of-accuracy-precision-recall}}

** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct
prediction. It's the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the
total number of predictions (the number of test data points).

** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as
spam, actually were spam. It is a ratio of true positives(words
classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all
words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct
classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of

\texttt{{[}True\ Positives/(True\ Positives\ +\ False\ Positives){]}}

** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that
actually were spam were classified by us as spam. It is a ratio of true
positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all
the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of

\texttt{{[}True\ Positives/(True\ Positives\ +\ False\ Negatives){]}}

For classification problems that are skewed in their classification
distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text
messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by
itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not
spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam,
hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false
positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such
cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be
combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean)
of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1,
with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we
are dealing with ratios).

    \hypertarget{question-1---naive-predictor-performace}{%
\subsubsection{Question 1 - Naive Predictor
Performace}\label{question-1---naive-predictor-performace}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than
  \$50,000, what would that model's accuracy and F-score be on this
  dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}accuracy\textquotesingle{}} and
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}fscore\textquotesingle{}} to be used later.
\end{itemize}

** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor
is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look
like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the
results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon
which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set,
getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start
from.

** HINT: **

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When we have a model that always predicts `1' (i.e.~the individual
  makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or
  False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative(`0' value)
  predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as
  our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as
  every prediction that we have made with value `1' that should have `0'
  becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is
  the total number of records we have in total.
\item
  Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in
  this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.

\hypertarget{random-forest}{%
\subsubsection{Random Forest}\label{random-forest}}

** Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can
be applied. **

Random Forest can be used to predict the likely sales performance of a
new product by using comprehensive sales and attribute data for similar
products that were launched in the past.

** What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? **

It can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It produces
great results in most cases, even without hyper-parameter tuning. The
hyper-parameters are generally easy to understand compared to other
models. Also, generated forests can be saved for future use on other
data.

** What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly? **

The main weakness of this model is the fact that it can take too long to
predict in situations where training speed is a major factor and there
are too many features.

** What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what
you know about the data? **

This model is a good candidate for the problem because the data has a
high number and variety of categorical and numerical features. Random
Forest implements a combination of random decision trees and averages
the results to produce close predictions. Additionally, it searches for
the best feature among each random subset of features, which contribute
to its renown ability to product satisfactory results.

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines

** Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can
be applied. **

In bioinformatics, a Support Vector Machine can be used to classify
patients' likelihood of succumbing to illnesses on the basis of their
genes.

** What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? **

This algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane that separates
classifications to correctly predict classifications when applied to new
data sets. In many scenarios, it can even successfully segregate
classifications in multi-dimensional space by transforming data using
linear algebra.

** What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly? **

On large data sets, SVMs are known for having training times that are
multitudes slower than other models. Also, choosing the appropriate
kernel for a model proves difficult in many cases.

** What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what
you know about the data? **

The data set isn't unreasonably large to train with using SVM, although
the training time is noticeably extensive. Also, the label only has two
classes, which reduces the required time to train (one model is needed
per classification).

\hypertarget{adaboost}{%
\subsubsection{AdaBoost}\label{adaboost}}

** Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can
be applied. **

Adaboost algorithms can be used to detect whether an object on an image
is a face. This is possible after a gray scale transformation is
conducted on an image and a thresholds are approximated to create face
boundaries.

** What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? **

Adaboost, like other models that fall under ``boosting,'' is an ensemble
method that creates a strong classifier from numerous weak classifiers.
To clarify, weak classifiers'' or ``weak learners'' are predictive
models that generate predictions with accuracies that are barely above
chance.

Adaboost is most suited when used with decision trees with one level
(decision stumps). Decision stumps are decision trees that learn by only
considering the attributes under one field when making a prediction
(i.e., male or female) in a dataset that would require multiple,
branching decisions involving the attributes under multiple fields to
derive a highly accurate prediction. Generating a prediction for the
dataset of this exercise by only considering gender would lead to a
highly inaccurate prediction.

Additionally, Adaboost was specifically developed for binary
classifications.

** What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly? **

Adaboost is only used for classification, and not regression.

Also, Adaboost is prone to overfitting under the following conditions: •
When used with complicated weak learners such as decision trees over one
level and models involving hyperplanes in multi-dimensional space • When
used on noisy datasets (excessive outliers, etc.) • When used on
high-dimensional datasets

** What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what
you know about the data? **

Adaboost is a great candidate for this problem because the label of the
dataset contains binary classifications. As is often the case, this
dataset is generally ideal for decision trees. And decision trees are
paired with the Adaboost model when one level of a decision tree is
utilized.

In the code cell, you will need to implement the following: - Import the
three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous
section. - Initialize the three models and store them in
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}clf\_A\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}clf\_B\textquotesingle{}}, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}clf\_C\textquotesingle{}}. - Use a
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}random\_state\textquotesingle{}} for each
model you use, if provided. - \textbf{Note:} Use the default settings
for each model --- you will tune one specific model in a later section.
- Calculate the number of records equal to 1\%, 10\%, and 100\% of the
training data. - Store those values in
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}samples\_1\textquotesingle{}},
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}samples\_10\textquotesingle{}}, and

\subsection{Improving Results}\label{improving-results}}

In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised
learning models the \emph{best} model to use on the student data. You
will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the
entire training set (\texttt{X\_train} and \texttt{y\_train}) by tuning
at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score.

** HINT: ** Look at the graph at the bottom left from the cell above(the
visualization created by
\texttt{vs.evaluate(results,\ accuracy,\ fscore)}) and check the F score
for the testing set when 100\% of the training set is used. Which model
has the highest score? Your answer should include discussion of the: *
metrics - F score on the testing when 100\% of the training data is
used, * prediction/training time * the algorithm's suitability for the
data.

    \textbf{Answer: }

Based on the results, the AdaBoost model is most appropriate for the
task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000. I reached
this conclusion based on the following reasons: • Out of the three
models, the AdaBoost model has the highest F-score on the testing set
when 100\% of the training data is used. • The AdaBoost model has a low
prediction/training time, especially when compared to the SVC model. •
AdaBoost is highly suitable for the data since the label is comprised of
two binary classifications.

When explaining your model, if using external resources please include

    \textbf{Answer: }

AdaBoost involves sequentially constructing a strong model by combining
multiple weak models. It is often used in conjunction with many other
types of learning algorithms to improve results. Also, AdaBoost is
adaptive because as it trains, subsequent models attempt to correct the
errors of prior models. Weak models are sequentially added and trained
within this adaptive process. The process continues until a pre-set
number of weak learners have been created and no further improvement can
be made based on the input criteria. Ultimately, predictions are made by
calculating the weighted average of the weak classifiers.

AdaBoost is best used to boost the performance of decision trees on
binary classification problems.

    \hypertarget{implementation-model-tuning}{%
\subsubsection{Implementation: Model
Tuning}\label{implementation-model-tuning}}

Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (\texttt{GridSearchCV}) with
at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values.
You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell
below, you will need to implement the following: - Import
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html}{\texttt{sklearn.grid\_search.GridSearchCV}}
and
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html}{\texttt{sklearn.metrics.make\_scorer}}.
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in \texttt{clf}.
- Set a \texttt{random\_state} if one is available to the same state you
set before. - Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the
chosen model. - Example:
\texttt{parameters\ =\ \{\textquotesingle{}parameter\textquotesingle{}\ :\ {[}list\ of\ values{]}\}}.
- \textbf{Note:} Avoid tuning the \texttt{max\_features} parameter of
your learner if that parameter is available! - Use \texttt{make\_scorer}
to create an \texttt{fbeta\_score} scoring object (with
\(\beta = 0.5\)). - Perform grid search on the classifier \texttt{clf}
using the \texttt{\textquotesingle{}scorer\textquotesingle{}}, and store
it in \texttt{grid\_obj}. - Fit the grid search object to the training
data (\texttt{X\_train}, \texttt{y\_train}), and store it in
\texttt{grid\_fit}.

\textbf{Note:} Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list,
the following implementation may take some time to run!

\subsection{Feature Importance}\label{feature-importance}}

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like
the census data we study here is determining which features provide the
most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a
few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding
of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the
case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of
features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most
or more than \$50,000.

Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that
has a \texttt{feature\_importance\_} attribute, which is a function that
ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier. In
the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this
attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census
dataset.

    \hypertarget{question-6---feature-relevance-observation}{%
\subsubsection{Question 6 - Feature Relevance
Observation}\label{question-6---feature-relevance-observation}}

When \textbf{Exploring the Data}, it was shown there are thirteen
available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of
these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most
important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?

    \textbf{Answer:}

I think it would be reasonable to assume that the following five
features are most important for prediction in this order: 1. **
occupation\_ Prof-specialty ** -- Individuals in fields of professional
specialty (technical, medical, law, etc.) tend to have higher wages than
people in other fields. 2. ** education\_level\_ Doctorate ** -- People
with higher levels of education tend to have higher wages than those
with lower levels of education. 3. ** age ** -- People with more years
of experience in the workforce tend to have higher wages. 4. **
relationship\_Husband ** -- Husbands are likely to have higher wages
than other types of people, maybe because of the general mindset that
marriage and leading a family encourages; there are also favorable
political considerations involved. 5. ** sex \_Male ** -- Unfortunately,
males may have the upper hand in this area; trends on salary data seem
to indicate this.

    \hypertarget{implementation---extracting-feature-importance}{%
\subsubsection{Implementation - Extracting Feature
Importance}\label{implementation---extracting-feature-importance}}

Choose a \texttt{scikit-learn} supervised learning algorithm that has a
\texttt{feature\_importance\_} attribute availble for it. This attribute
is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making
predictions based on the chosen algorithm.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following: -
Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from
the three used earlier. - Train the supervised model on the entire
training set. - Extract the feature importances using
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}.feature\_importances\_\textquotesingle{}}.

\subsubsection{Question 7 - Extracting Feature
Importance}\label{question-7---extracting-feature-importance}}

Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most
relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above
\$50,000.\\
* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed
in \textbf{Question 6}? * If you were close to the same answer, how does
this visualization confirm your thoughts? * If you were not close, why
do you think these features are more relevant?

    \textbf{Answer:}

** How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed
in Question 6? **

I chose two of the five correct features. I did not choose
hours-per-week, capital-gain, and marital-status\_Married. I did not
believe hours-per-week and marital-status made such a difference. I
should have considered capital-gain more closely because this feature
can generally indicate the ownership of property.

** If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization
confirm your thoughts? **

I was certain that age would have a high correlation with income because
numerous charts and analysis on economic websites support this
conclusion. The feature ``relationship\_Husband'' seemed obvious because
this type of person usually has the highest wealth in every related
observation I've seen.

** If you were not close, why do you think these features are more
relevant? **

The feature ``hours-per-week'' probably ranked high because workers with
hourly wages in some professions can make significant amounts of money
with overtime pay.

The feature ``capital-gain'' likely ranks high since it indicates that
an individual recently sold property and that individual likely has
other assets to manage. It seems unlikely that a person would sell all
of his or her property.

The feature ``marital-status\_Married'' is highly predictive, probably
because marriage encourages a mindset and societal perception conductive
to setting career goals, financial planning, leadership, and personal
branding.

    \hypertarget{feature-selection}{%
\subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection}}

How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available
features in the data? With less features required to train, the
expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower --- at
the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see
that the top five most important features contribute more than half of
the importance of \textbf{all} features present in the data. This hints
that we can attempt to \emph{reduce the feature space} and simplify the
information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will
use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same
training set \emph{with only the top five important features}.

  How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced

\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Answer:}

** How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced
data using only five features compare to those same scores when all
features are used? **

The F-score on the reduced data is much lower than on the full data
(61.2\% as opposed to 71.3\%, respectively). The difference is
substantial enough to raise concerns.

The accuracy on the reduced data is slightly lower than on the full data
(81.3\% as opposed to 85\%, respectively). The accuracy numbers
definitely seem close.

** If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced
data as your training set? **

Since the F-score is so much lower on the reduced data, I would not
consider using the reduced data as my training set. If I added two to
four more features, perhaps the F-score would be satisfactorily closer.
